# University-database
A database consisting of Students, Professors, Departments, Courses etc which demonstrate several types of table relations such as 1-many between professors and department or many-many between students and courses.
The main database handles setting up the tables, as well as some basic procedures such as creating a new group of students, demonstrating the use of a view to create a makeshift student schedule, implementing a trigger that automates listing a new course, and also creating two new nonclustered indexes. 
The Select folder demonstrates the use of diverse select statements, each demonstrating the use of a different tool such as 'inner/left/right join', 'exists', 'distinct', 'count' which is also used in combination with 'avg', or 'min', and other tools that may be useful when handling an SQL database. 
The version loop has several changes to our database such as creating a new table, adding a new collumn in a table, and other such things and then implements a stored procedure that allows the user to revert those changes with just entering the version they would like to be using.
